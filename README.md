# local-bmc

localized version of buy me a coffee script, to prohibit any external connections when there is no interactions by the user.

## usage

all you have to do is to replace the js script link from buy me a coffee with a path to the custom script

### example

<script data-name="BMC-Widget" data-cfasync="false" src="/../bmc.js" data-id="arhackintosh" data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message="" data-color="#BD5FFF" data-position="Right" data-x_margin="18" data-y_margin="18"></script>

here the user id is **arhackintosh** and the color is purple all i did was just replace the link, and the scipt will do the rest for you.
